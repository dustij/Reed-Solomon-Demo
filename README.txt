[x] Replace spinners with custom hex spinners
[x] Clicking Encode will also populate the hex spinners the same time polynomial labels are generated
[x] Change color for spinners that are modified by the user
[ ] Ensure formatting and spacing looks nice (spinners are same width, spacing and padding, etc.)
[ ] Add the last section on decoding
[ ] Allow message any size between 1 and 12 (currently only works with exactly 12)
[ ] add powers to p(x)
[ ] move decode up
[ ] move hex spinners up (polynomial explanations at bottom)
